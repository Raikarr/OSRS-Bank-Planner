# OSRS-Bank-Planner
 Plan out your dream bank to help organize your in-game bank.


This program works just as the bank in-game does, with the added feature of having every single item in game at your disposal.

If you are like myself, and would like to plan out the perfect bank setup, but find this difficult because you are too poor and can't afford most items this program can help you plan out and organize so you know where there will go when you finally own them.

This program is a work in progress and will be continuously updated until finished (at an unknown date). I will do my best to update the item images, and ID's with game updates so all the most current items and images are available.

If you find any items in the 'inventory' that should not be there (because they are unbankable) please send me a message (preferrably on reddit at /u/Girtag). Having proof of an item being unbankable is always best as well!

If you find any glitches or crashes, please also contact me and let me know all you can about the error.

Thank you, and have fun!
